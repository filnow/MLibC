# About


This repository is an attempt to implement as many of the machine learning algorithms found in the [ISLR](https://hastie.su.domains/ISLR2/ISLRv2_website.pdf) book as possible.

The end goal is to be able to implement a neural network from scratch in C.

It is always good to learn some C or at least try.
